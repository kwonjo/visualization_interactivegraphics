# What is happiness? \ˈha-pē-nəs\?\ [Happiness Project](https://kwonjo.github.io/algorithms_interactivegraphics/)

## What is the project about?

This project defines "happiness" with five happy tracks that I chose from Billboard chart's top 20 "happy" tracks. 
1. “Happy Together,” The Turtles 
2. “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” from “Cocktail,” Bobby McFerrin 
8. “Happy Days,” Pratt & McClain with Brother Love 
17. "Happy," Pharrell 
20. "Oh How Happy," Shades Of Blue 
The lyrics of each song was combined and a text analysis with R was done to find the high frequency words. The top 50 were the followings in the graph.

The total of 201 words were aggregrated and the top 50 keywords were identified and used in this piece. The move of the words are random so the outcomes of the movement will always be different. 


## How did I come up with the idea?

This month I have been obsessed with Joey Pecoraro's song "To be happy." The song only has a short monologue in the beginning and it states how to be happy. 

*"We all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy, because they want something else or they want more of the same.
And we all know people who have lots of misfortune, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness.
Why? Because they are grateful."*

I wanted to define "happiness" so I looked it up on the dictionary and it stated as "a state of well-being and contentment." This did not seem to be a sufficient definition. In order to define "happiness," some text were required. I went back to think how Pecoraro's song was spreading happiness to people. Music is an essential element in our lives that gives us happiness. Therefore, I wanted to incorporate music lyrics to define "happiness." 


## How was this piece created?

## 1. [Top 20 'Happy' Songs of All Time](https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/5915801/top-20-happy-songs-of-all-time)
 was used for text analysis. I chose five songs that made me happy from the top 20. The reason for this selection was that I believe that this is my definition of happiness and not the definition from the Billboard chart. In addition, some of the songs in the top 20 did not give a happiness vibe such as Avril Lavigne's "My Happy Ending."

*The ranking is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart.*

## 2. R was used for text analysis
R's tm, SnowballC, wordcloud packages allow text analysis and creation of word clouds. 

This is following R codes that I used: 

```{r}
## Making a word cloud with English text
# Install and load packages
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("SnowballC")
install.packages("wordcloud")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Read the text file
setwd("/Users/jkwon/Desktop/Jo2018/2018interactivegraphics/p5_algorithms/happyfile")
text <- readLines("combinehappy.txt", warn=F)
docs<-Corpus(VectorSource(text))
inspect(docs)

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)

# Top 50 words/lyrics
frequency <- head(d, 50)
write.table(frequency, "happyfre.txt", sep="\t", row.names=F)

# Bar graph for top 50
barplot(d[1:50,]$freq, las = 3, names.arg = d[1:50,]$word,
        col ="lightblue", main ="Most frequent Top 50 words",
        ylab = "Word frequencies")

# Wordcloud for words with a frequency above 2
set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 3,
          max.words=100, scale=c(4, 0.5), random.order=F, rot.per= 0.15, 
          colors=brewer.pal(7, "Accent"))

```

## 3. [Color Selection](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2018-tools-for-designers)
![pantone](/images/color2018.png)

Every year Pantone introduces the color of the year and the color of the year 2018 is ultra violet(18-3838).I have always had the interest in Pantone's selections and this year's color was attractive to me. The "Floral Fantasies" selection seemed interesting and I have wanted to incorporate it in some of my work. I have used violet, peach, and lettuce green for this piece. This project was a great opportunity to use similar shades of what Pantone has suggested. 

## 4. The use of interaction 

This project used algorithms and chance operations. The use of chance operations seemed to limit the user interaction with the piece. As a result, I used a "if-else" statement to allow some interaction from the user. When the mouse is pressed, the sound track will play and a smiley :) with changing eye colors will appear on the canvas. 

```javascript
    //Mouse pressed
    if(mouseIsPressed){
        //trigger sound
        mySound.play();
        mySound.setVolume(0.12);

        //smiley face
        stroke(153, 204, 153);
        strokeWeight(3);
        ellipseMode(CENTER);
        //change eye color
        fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));
        ellipse(100, 230, 10, 10);
        ellipse(165, 230, 10, 10);
        noFill(); 
        arc(130, 280, 100, 120, 0.2, PI - 0.2);
    }else{
        noStroke();
    }
```

## 5. Classes in p5js 

A class is defined to enable the words from the top 50 frequency to move around the screen randomly.

```javascript
class Word{ 
        constructor(tempX, tempY, tempWidth, tempHeight, tempShade, tempSpeed, tempText){
        this.x = tempX;
        this.y = tempY;
        this.w = tempWidth;
        this.h = tempHeight;
        this.shade = tempShade;
        this.speed = tempSpeed;
        this.text = tempText;
    }

    //display 
    display(){
        text(this.text, this.x, this.y);
    }

    move(){
    this.x += random(0,1);
    this.y += random(-45, 45);
  }
  
}
```
