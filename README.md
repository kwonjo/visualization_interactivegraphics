## Project: What is ART? 

### Conceptual Description

I've been defining different terms throughoutthis semester and I believe that a crucial term in this class is "art." I want to explore the definitions of "art" from quotes from artists. I found 99 quotes from famous artists defining "art."

### Interaction Description

Replace with a description of the interactive dimensions of your project.  How do you expect users to interact with your piece. How is your piece to be set up in physical space? Who is the intended audience? How does your piece inform the user through interaction or amplifies those your project's main concepts and ideas?

### Extension 

Do you intend to extend a piece that you've created throughout the semester? What elements are you adding or subtracting from the previous piece? How do these extensions/subtractions further develop the conceptual and interactive elements of your work?
