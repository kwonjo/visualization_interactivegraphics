*It's a dark and shiny place*

## 3. [Color Selection (2018)](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2018-tools-for-designers) 
![PANTONE](/images/color2018.png)

Every year PANTONE introduces the color of the year and the color of the year 2018 is ultra violet(18-3838). I was always interested in Pantone's selections and this year's color was attractive to me. The "Floral Fantasies" selection was my favorite and I wanted to incorporate it in this work. I used violet, peach, and lettuce green, and yellow for this piece. I converted the Pantone colors into RGB colors for the p5js. 

Violet: color(140, 109, 211)
Peach: color(253, 122, 131)
Lettuce Green: color(53, 204, 153)
Yellow: color(242, 240, 161)
