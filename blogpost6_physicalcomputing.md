### 1. Waveforms (The Art of Sound) by Carrie Bodle, Jacob C. Hammes, Norbert Herber/Rowland Ricketts, Tesia Kosmalski, Lou Mallozzi, Shannon McMullen/Fabian Winkler, Stephanie Rowden, and Jesse Seay

Waveforms uses sound into its art. The sounds are physically made and shown visually which makes it physical computing. As the curators and artists mention in the video that sound is used in a different form in this art. First of all, this work's central theme is sound. Many art works incorporate visual components or use sound as a supplementary form. I believe that this new incorporation of different senses will allow people to understand and appreciate art in different forms. 

*"Integrating the use of different senses allow the brain to perceive the world accurately (Groeger, 2012)."* 

I especially like this piece because the artists mention that this "new" form of art is startling to people at first but it still intrigues new thoughts and sense of people. In addition, people are challenged to perceive art in different forms from the conventional art. The artists also mention that they will continue in new forms of art. This will allow artists to expand the definition of art and people to be open to variety of art.

### 2. Watching by Camila Vargas Restrepo

This project is from my class "Physical Computing" last semester. After the presentation of the final projects, I really liked the project and went back to Camila's github to read the descriptions. Creating a birch clock with a Raspberry Pie was the physical computing componet that seemed challenging and impressive. However, the most intriguing element was the concept how the clock was going backwards. The project *Watching* had the clock move counterclockwise when no one was looking but it would move clockwise when someone was looking at the clock. This idea of "losing time" was a concept that is not thought often and her inspiration from the fiction novel *Momo* was solid. The framework that she created for the work with the technology had made people question and interested. I also liked how she stated the project can be interpreted in various ways. All works of art seem to have no answer and interpreted differently among people and time.

### 3. You Know I'm No Good by Rachel Harrison

This art piece was shown in 2015 and I found this artist from Matt's recommendation. It has faces and peoples on the drawings. Amy Winehouse's life and music inspired the art. The drawings may seem simple and the colors are vivid. The one hugely displayed in the webpage shows one side of Amy Winehouse. Some are frawn with one color and it is clearly visible that the drawing is the singer. I like this piece because of the connection of the drawing overall. The hair and the mic cord are connected and her upper body is also connected to her face and arm. It seems like the drawing may have been drawn with only a few lines. I would like to read and hear more about the piece from the artist.
