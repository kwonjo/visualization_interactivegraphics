# Blog Post After Going to THE_OPER&

[Here's a link to THE_OPER&](https://dukeperformances.duke.edu/events/world-premiere-the_oper-john-supko-bill-seaman-directed-jim-findlay-performed-lorelei-ensemble/)

This piece visualizes paths of air traffic over North America. It uses various colors and form. The form that is shown in the videos are loosely connected lines but there are other forms such as the spreading liquid which was interesting. I wonder how the 3D component was created. The North America's map is vaguely seen and created with all the complex lines and routes of the air traffic. The piece used FAA data that was parsed and plotted with the use of Processing. I wonder if the colors are greatly random. I wish there was more details of the coding and what was his goals to this project. It is interesting how there is no map in the background. The vaguely connected lines create the image of the map without having an underlying map but our perceptions are influence to create the "big picture" which is a map in this case.
