# Blog Post After Going to THE_OPER&

[Here's a link to THE_OPER&](https://dukeperformances.duke.edu/events/world-premiere-the_oper-john-supko-bill-seaman-directed-jim-findlay-performed-lorelei-ensemble/)

I went to the Friday night show of The Oper&. I liked the whole performance but I wanted to know how much the AI was working on the sound, the images, and the text. I really liked how the sound, the images, and the text interacting to each other and created a story. My question was how wide the range of selections of the components are in the set of selections. The performers did not seem to be surprised and they were calm in the performace. I wonder how the performers practice and do not get distracted to the new variables that can hinder or surprse their performances. It seems the rehearsal for the performers will be challenging. I hope to learn more about the function and theory of the Oper&.
