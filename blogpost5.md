### 2. Flight Quest (2013) 
*Airline companies are constantly looking for ways to make flight more efficient. From gate conflicts to operational challenges to air traffic management, the dynamics of a flight can change quickly and lead to costly delays.

Fortunately, advancements in real-time big data analysis are changing the course of flights as we know it. Imagine if pilots could augment their decision-making process with "real time business intelligence" â€” information available in the cockpit that would allow them to make adjustments to their flight patterns.

Several amazing contestants submitted useable and scalable algorithms based on model data that improved flight arrival prediction times by up to 40% saving fuel, cabin crew costs and time. This visualization helps explain just how much saving 2.5 minutes per flight can save an airline. Once the animation is complete, you can create your scenario by changing the airline size and the number of minutes to save.*
