# Blog Post 5 & Task 2 (Storyboard)

### 1. Flight Patterns by Aaron Koblin

[Here's a link to the piece](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-pattern/)

This piece visualizes paths of air traffic over North America. It uses various colors and form. The form that is shown in the videos are loosely connected lines but there are other forms such as the spreading liquid which was interesting. I wonder how the 3D component was created. The North America's map is vaguely seen and created with all the complex lines and routes of the air traffic. The piece used FAA data that was parsed and plotted with the use of Processing. I wonder if the colors are greatly random. I wish there was more details of the coding and what was his goals to this project. It is interesting how there is no map in the background. The vaguely connected lines create the image of the map without having an underlying map but our perceptions are influence to create the "big picture" which is a map in this case.

### 2. Flight Quest (2013) 
*"Airline companies are constantly looking for ways to make flight more efficient. From gate conflicts to operational challenges to air traffic management, the dynamics of a flight can change quickly and lead to costly delays.Fortunately, advancements in real-time big data analysis are changing the course of flights as we know it. Imagine if pilots could augment their decision-making process with "real time business intelligence" â€” information available in the cockpit that would allow them to make adjustments to their flight patterns. Several amazing contestants submitted useable and scalable algorithms based on model data that improved flight arrival prediction times by up to 40% saving fuel, cabin crew costs and time. This visualization helps explain just how much saving 2.5 minutes per flight can save an airline. Once the animation is complete, you can create your scenario by changing the airline size and the number of minutes to save."*

Flight Quest was created for GE and this interactive tool allows the company to improve estimated flight arrival times. In addition, it attempts to save the costs for airlines to efficient. This piece is similar to Koblin's piece but with a different objective. The objective of this piece is clearly commercial use and less focus on aesthetics. With the objective of finding the best routes, the visualization is clearly showing the airports and how the airplanes are moving around the United States. Although this project is less abstract and less appealing aesthetically, the objective is accomplished. I like how the previous piece and this piece are so similar but so different in some ways.

### 3. Storyboard for Visualization Project

My MA thesis on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and I am aiming to define AI by first subcategorizing the topics and ideas related to AI. I would like the user to interact with the different concepts by having some control over the texts.
